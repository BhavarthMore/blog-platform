## Getting Started

For setup

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest blog-platform 
```
Then Clone this repository in the built folder

First, run the frontend server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Then, run the backend server:

```bash
cd blog-backend
node index.js
```
## Storage

For Simplicity I've used in-Memory Database from Sqlite
